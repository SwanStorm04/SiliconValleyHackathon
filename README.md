# SiliconValleyHackathon
My project for the 2020 silicon valley hackathon
This project is a way for anyone to find resources for what they need, especially during these times. There are buttons that lead to groups
of websites with information so people can get good results for what they want. Just run the main menu exe and you can get to anything wanted.
The other files house the code that is compiled in the main menu exe.
